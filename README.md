# Safety Dashboard ‚Äì Real-time Environmental Hazards Monitor

A comprehensive ‚ÄúWaze for hazards + weather‚Äù environmental monitoring system providing real-time safety insights across US territories through advanced geospatial visualization and multi-source hazard tracking.

---

## Overview

The Safety Dashboard is a professional-grade environmental monitoring application that displays real-time safety data on an interactive Leaflet map, restricted to the lower 48 US states. The system integrates multiple authentic data sources to provide users with critical safety information for informed decision-making.
